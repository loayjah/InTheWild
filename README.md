# In The Wild


## Background

This website of a tourism agency was my final project of a first-year web design course (CSCI1170) where I performed good practices of web design. Starting from the process of basic user research: user personas, wire frames and prototypes, usability and accessibility evaluations, and ending at implementing the final product using clean, high-quality HTML and CSS code.

This website is live on: https://loayjah.github.io/InTheWild/
